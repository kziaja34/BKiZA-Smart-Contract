# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat node
```
And React frontend on:

```
npm run dev
```
